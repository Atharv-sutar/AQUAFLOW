## 1. Overview

This project uses an ESP32 to control two pumps (via an L298N-style motor driver). The ESP32 reads a soil moisture sensor and sends the moisture percentage to Firebase. A mobile app (MIT App Inventor) writes commands into the Firebase Realtime Database so the ESP32 can read and act on them.

Commands are simple strings (`pump1_toggle`, `pump2_toggle`, `both_on`, `both_off`, `auto`, `standby`). The ESP32 polls the RTDB frequently (every ~150 ms in this sketch) and acts when it sees a non-`standby` command.

---

## 2. Features

* Control two pumps independently or both together
* Manual toggles and an `auto` routine
* Soil-moisture reading uploaded to Firebase
* Pump status published to Firebase (`pump1_status`, `pump2_status`)
* Simple MIT App Inventor UI to send commands and display status

---

## 3. Hardware required

* ESP32 (WROOM) board
* L298N motor driver (or equivalent H-bridge) for the pumps
* 2 DC pumps (or motors) compatible with your driver and supply
* Soil moisture analog sensor
* Proper power supply for motors (e.g. 12V) and for the ESP32 (5V via USB or regulated 3.3V) — do **not** feed 12V directly to the ESP32
* Connecting wires, breadboard, resistors as needed

---

## 4. Wiring / Pin mapping

This is the pin mapping used by the sketch. Update pins in the code if your wiring differs.

| Function          | ESP32 Pin |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| Pump 1 IN1        | 26        |
| Pump 1 IN2        | 25        |
| Pump 1 ENA (PWM)  | 14        |
| Pump 2 IN3        | 27        |
| Pump 2 IN4        | 33        |
| Pump 2 ENB (PWM)  | 12        |
| Soil analog input | 32        |

Notes:

* ENA/ENB are PWM pins. Depending on your motor driver you might also need to connect driver enable jumpers.
* Pumps should be powered from the motor supply (e.g. 12V). Ensure common GND between motor supply and ESP32 ground.
* The soil sensor uses the ESP32 ADC (0..4095). Calibrate the mapping ranges to your sensor and soil.

---

## 5. Libraries & software prerequisites

* Arduino IDE or PlatformIO with ESP32 board support installed
* Libraries used in the sketch:

  * `Firebase_ESP_Client` (for RTDB interactions)
  * `WiFi.h` (ESP32 builtin)
* MIT App Inventor (web app) to create the Android companion app

Install `Firebase_ESP_Client` and its addons (`TokenHelper.h`, `RTDBHelper.h`) via Library Manager or from the library repository.

---

## 6. Firebase setup

1. Create a Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com.
2. In **Realtime Database** create a database and set rules. For testing you may use relaxed rules but for production lock it down and require authentication.

Example minimal rules for development (NOT for production):

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```

3. In *Project settings* -> *General* copy the `API Key` and the `Realtime Database URL` — these go into the sketch as `API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`.
4. If you are using the legacy database secret, you can find it under *Project Settings* -> *Service accounts* -> *Database secrets* (deprecated in new projects). Prefer using Firebase Authentication or proper tokens instead of embedding legacy secrets.

**RTDB paths used by the sketch**

* `/ESP_32/command` — string: command to execute
* `/ESP_32/pump1_status` — integer (0 or 1)
* `/ESP_32/pump2_status` — integer (0 or 1)
* `/ESP_32/autoState` — integer (0 or 1) showing `auto` routine running
* `/ESP_32/response` — integer: calculated soil moisture percentage

---

## 7. ESP32 sketch: overview and important notes

Key constants and logic:

* `checkInterval` = 150ms: ESP checks the `/ESP_32/command` node every 150ms.
* `interval` = 5000ms: soil moisture measurement is uploaded roughly every 5 seconds.
* Commands implemented: `pump1_toggle`, `pump2_toggle`, `both_on`, `both_off`, `auto`.
* After executing a command the ESP writes `standby` back into `/ESP_32/command`.

### Important implementation notes and suggestions

* The sketch updates the pump states to the DB every time a pump on/off occurs. This helps the mobile UI stay in sync.
* Currently the code calls `return;` when it reads `"standby"`. That returns from `loop()` immediately — which is usually fine because `loop()` restarts, but if you want additional checks or code after the command handling block, remove `return;` so the code continues executing in the same loop iteration.
* When writing `standby` back to the DB, be sure the `setString()` call succeeds — you might optionally check the return boolean before proceeding.

### `pumpAuto()` routine

It sets `autoState = 1`, turns both pumps on, waits for 10 seconds, turns off pump 1, waits 5 seconds, then turns off pump 2 and clears `autoState`.

This function uses `delay()` which blocks the main loop for the duration. If you need responsiveness while auto runs, convert it into a non-blocking state machine using `millis()`.

## 8. MIT App Inventor: components & blocks (how-to)

### Components (suggested)

* `FirebaseDB` component (set `FirebaseURL`, `FirebaseToken`/Auth token)
* Buttons: `btnPump1`, `btnPump2`, `btnBothOn`, `btnBothOff`, `btnAuto`
* Labels: `lblPump1Status`, `lblPump2Status`, `lblSoilMoisture`
* Notifier (optional) for error messages

### Basic behavior

1. When user taps a button, call `FirebaseDB.StoreValue` with tag `/ESP_32/command` and value one of the command strings:

   * Pump1 toggle: `pump1_toggle`
   * Pump2 toggle: `pump2_toggle`
   * Both on: `both_on`
   * Both off: `both_off`
   * Auto: `auto`

2. To display pump states and soil moisture, have the app either:

   * Periodically call `FirebaseDB.GetValue` for `/ESP_32/pump1_status`, `/ESP_32/pump2_status`, `/ESP_32/response` and update labels on `GotValue` event, OR
   * Use `FirebaseDB`'s tag change event (if available in your AI2 extension) so the app is notified when the value changes.

### Example MIT AI2 pseudoblocks

```
When btnPump1.Click
  FirebaseDB.StoreValue tag: "/ESP_32/command" value: "pump1_toggle"

When FirebaseDB.GotValue tag = "/ESP_32/pump1_status"
  set lblPump1Status.Text to value

When FirebaseDB.GotValue tag = "/ESP_32/response"
  set lblSoilMoisture.Text to value + "%"
```

Note: MIT App Inventor component names and events can differ slightly depending on which Firebase extension you are using (the built-in FirebaseDB in AI2, or community extensions). The method names above are general — consult the exact component documentation in the Designer/Blocks drawer.

## 9. Database structure (example JSON)

```json
{
  "ESP_32": {
    "command": "standby",
    "pump1_status": 0,
    "pump2_status": 0,
    "autoState": 0,
    "response": 42
  }
}
```

## 10. Troubleshooting & optimizations

**Commands appear in DB but ESP doesn't respond quickly**

* Your sketch polls every 150 ms (set by `checkInterval`). Polling too fast can cause a lot of read operations and may hit limits. Consider:

  * Using the Firebase RTDB streaming/stream listener features (supported by `Firebase_ESP_Client`) for near-instant pushes to the ESP without repeated reads.
  * Increase `checkInterval` slightly and test responsiveness vs. costs.

**Commands flip back instantly in the DB**

* The app might be writing `standby` or another command quickly after. Check your app logic to ensure it only writes what you expect.
* Ensure the ESP only sets `standby` after successfully executing the command.

**Soil reading looks wrong or very noisy**

* Calibrate ADC ranges for your sensor & add smoothing (moving average) or median filtering.
* Remember ESP32 ADC values range about `0..4095` depending on attenuation settings.

**Using ****************************`delay()`**************************** in pumpAuto blocks polls**

* Convert `pumpAuto()` to a non-blocking state-machine if you need to remain responsive to other commands while `auto` is running.

**Checkpoints for debugging**

* Use `Serial.print()` statements liberally to see what the ESP reads/writes.
* Check the Firebase console to see the live RTDB and verify values being written.

## 11. Security & deployment notes

* **Do not publish your API key or database secret.** Treat them like credentials. For public repositories, remove secrets and use environment variables or instructions for users to insert their own keys.
* Legacy database secrets are deprecated. Use Firebase Authentication and secure rules to restrict who can write/read. For device-to-database trust you can use Cloud Functions or custom tokens instead of embedding secrets in firmware.
* Monitor read/write usage and bandwidth in Firebase dashboard to avoid hitting free-tier limits.

## 12. FAQ

**Q: Why does the ESP set ****************************`standby`**************************** after executing a command?**
A: It’s a simple way to indicate that the command was consumed and to avoid repeatedly performing the same action when the call is polled again.

**Q: How to make the app instantly reflect pump states?**
A: Ensure the ESP updates `/ESP_32/pump1_status` and `/ESP_32/pump2_status` immediately after changing outputs. Have the app either poll those tags or listen for changes.

**Q: Can I reduce latency and Firebase usage?**
A: Use RTDB streaming (push-based) listeners on the ESP so the database sends updates only when values change. Convert blocking delays to `millis()`-based non-blocking logic.

Q: Why use analogWrite instead of ledc functions ?

A: On the ESP32 the preferred, native way to generate PWM is the LEDC API (`ledcSetup`, `ledcAttachPin`, `ledcWrite`) because it's hardware PWM and offers better control (frequency, resolution, multiple channels). However, in this project **`analogWrite()`**** was used as a deliberate workaround** for the following reason:

* Despite multiple attempts to update/reinstall the ESP32 board package and related libraries, the LEDC/`ledc` functions would not compile on the developer's environment. That prevented successful building of the app.
